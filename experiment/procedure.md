## Procedure

### Apparatus:
AC power source, Rheostat, Capacitor, Inductor, Reisistor, Voltmeter, Ammeter, connection wire etc.


<p><strong>Components:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Resistor:</strong> A resistor is a two-terminal electronic component that produces a voltage across its terminals that is proportional to the electric current through it in accordance with Ohm's law.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Lamp:</strong> A lamp is a replaceable component such as an incandescent light bulb, which is designed to produce light from electricity. These components usually have a base of ceramic, metal, glass, or plastic, which makes an electrical connection in the socket of a light fixture.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Wire:</strong> A wire is a single, usually cylindrical, elongated string of metal. Wires are used to bear mechanical loads and to carry electricity and telecommunication signals. Wire is commonly formed by drawing the metal through a hole in a die or draw plate.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Switch:</strong> In electronics, a switch is an electrical component that can break an electrical circuit, interrupt, or divert the current from one conductor to another.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Battery:</strong> In electronics, a battery or voltaic cell is a combination of many electrochemical Galvanic cells of identical type that can store chemical energy and can deliver higher voltage or higher current compared to single cells.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Voltmeter:</strong> A voltmeter is an instrument used for measuring the electrical potential difference between two points in an electric circuit. Analog voltmeters move a pointer across a scale in proportion to the voltage of the circuit; digital voltmeters give a numerical display of voltage by using an analog to digital converter.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Ammeter:</strong> An ammeter is a measuring instrument used to measure the electric current in a circuit. Electric currents are measured in amperes (A), hence the name.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Non-contact ammeter:</strong> A type of ammeter that need not be a part of the circuit.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Select the components from the right side of the simulator.</li>
  <li>Connect them as in the figure: 1.</li>
  <li>Connection with wire is complete only when the black color appears at its ends.</li>
  <li>Change the frequency of the A.C. source and measure the current in the ammeter for each frequency.</li>
  <li>Plot a graph between frequency and current.</li>
  <li>Repeat the experiment for different values of <strong>R</strong>.</li>
</ol>
